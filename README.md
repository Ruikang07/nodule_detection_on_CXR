# nodule_detection_on_CXR
CISC 881 course project

<br>This project is trying to compare the performance of YOLOv5 and SoftTeacher 
<br>on a custom dataset of chest X-ray images.
<br><br>The raw datasets came from  NODE21 CXR training dataset and
<br>VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection dataset.
<br><br>The labeled Dataset (train set and val set) was made from NODE21 dataset. 
<br><br>The unlabeled dataset used by Soft Teacher was made from images with nodules 
<br>in VinBigData dataset and unused background images from NODE21 dataset.
