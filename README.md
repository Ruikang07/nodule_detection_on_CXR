# nodule_detection_on_CXR
CISC 881 course project

<br>This project is trying to compare the performance of YOLOv5 and SoftTeacher on a custom dataset of chest X-ray images.
<br>The raw datasets came from  NODE21 CXR training dataset10 and VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection dataset.
<br>The labeled Dataset (train set and val set) is made from NODE21 dataset. The unlabeled dataset used by Soft Teacher is made from images with nodules in VinBigData dataset and unused background images from NODE21 dataset.
