# nodule_detection_on_CXR
CISC 881 course project

<br>This project is trying to compare the performance of YOLOv5 and SoftTeacher on a custom dataset of chest X-ray images.
<br>The raw datasets came from  NODE21 CXR training dataset10 and VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection dataset.
<br>The labeled Dataset (train set and val set) was made from NODE21 dataset. The unlabeled dataset used by Soft Teacher 
<br>was made from images with nodules in VinBigData dataset and unused background images from NODE21 dataset.
